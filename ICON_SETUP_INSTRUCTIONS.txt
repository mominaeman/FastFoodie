FastFoodie App Icon Setup Instructions
========================================

STEP 1: Save the FastFoodie Logo
---------------------------------
1. Right-click on the FastFoodie logo image you have
2. Save it as: D:\dbms_project\food_delivery_sys\assets\icon.png
3. Make sure the file is named exactly "icon.png"
4. Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels (the system will resize automatically)

STEP 2: Generate App Icons
---------------------------
After saving the icon.png file, run this command in the terminal:

    cd D:\dbms_project\food_delivery_sys
    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

This will automatically generate all the required icon sizes for Android.

STEP 3: Rebuild and Install the App
------------------------------------
    flutter build apk --release
    flutter install -d RF8T405JR2R

RESULT:
-------
✓ App name will show as "FastFoodie" (already configured)
✓ App icon will show the FastFoodie burger delivery logo

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
✓ AndroidManifest.xml already has "FastFoodie" as the app name
✓ pubspec.yaml configured with flutter_launcher_icons
✓ Assets folder created
✗ Icon image needs to be saved manually (see STEP 1)

Once you complete STEP 1, run the commands in STEP 2 and STEP 3.
